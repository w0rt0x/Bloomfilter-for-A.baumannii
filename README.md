# Internship project: using Bloomfilters for taxononmic assignment of A.baumannii
Code partly from / inspired by https://github.com/Phelimb/BIGSI

This code has been used to create a BIGSI-like Bloomfilter for the 8 Clonetypes of A.baumannii. Please note that the code and the project of the internship/thesis is still not finished (yet).

tl;dr: Multiple Bloomfilters saved as a matrix, used to identify A.baumannii bacteria Clonetypes
